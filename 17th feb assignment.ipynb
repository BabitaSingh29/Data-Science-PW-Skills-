    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database system that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use for developers. MongoDB has become popular due to its ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data and its horizontal scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database that does not use the traditional relational model to store data. Instead, NoSQL databases store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. These databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and to be highly scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. This includes applications that require frequent updates or have complex data structures that do not fit well into a traditional relational database schema. MongoDB is also ideal for applications that require real-time data analysis, as it supports advanced features like sharding and replication, which allow for distributed processing and high availability.

    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to handle unstructured data. This means that each document can have its own unique structure, unlike traditional relational databases where all data must fit into a pre-defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High Availability and Scalability: MongoDB offers high availability and scalability through replica sets and sharding, allowing users to easily distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of data.\n",
