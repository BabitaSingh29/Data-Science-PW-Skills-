    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class can be derived from an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and behaviors of the existing class, which can then be modified or extended to create a specialized version of the original class.\n",

    "**Single inheritance: Single inheritance occurs when a class is derived from a single base class. For example, a Student class could inherit from a Person class, where the Person class contains common properties such as name and age, and the Student class adds specialized properties such as student ID and major.\n",

    "**Multiple inheritance: Multiple inheritance occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class. For example, a Musician class could inherit from both a Person class and a MusicalInstrument class, where the Person class contains properties such as name and age and the MusicalInstrument class contains properties such as type of instrument and skill level.\n",
