Linear regression is used for problems like predicting house prices based on features. Logistic regression is suitable for scenarios like predicting whether a student passes or fails an exam based on study hours (where the outcome is binary - pass/fail)."

    "The cost function in logistic regression is the logarithmic loss (or cross-entropy loss). It measures the error between predicted probabilities and actual binary outcomes. Optimization is achieved by minimizing this cost function using algorithms like gradient descent. The goal is to adjust model parameters iteratively, finding the optimal values that minimize the overall error in predicting binary outcomes."

    "Regularization in logistic regression involves adding a penalty term to the cost function, discouraging overly complex models by penalizing large coefficients. It helps prevent overfitting by balancing between fitting the training data and simplicity. Regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization constrain the coefficients, reducing their magnitude and thus preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific features."
