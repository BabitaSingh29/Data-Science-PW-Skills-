    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with a predefined schema. The schema defines the columns and data types for each table, and the relationships between the tables. SQL databases use SQL as their query language to retrieve and manipulate data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, dynamic schemas. NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of unstructured data. Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."
